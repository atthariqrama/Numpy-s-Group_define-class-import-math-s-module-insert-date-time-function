# Numpy-s-Group_define-class-import-math-s-module-insert-date-time-function

1. Defining Class on our Program is really useful to make our job easier, we can make the code first that usually contain some function to operate and display something, and the we just call the class function that we are defined before to the main program.

2. Inserting date & time just by recent date or other time we want on to our program can be apply with some function.

3. This section we also want to describe how we use math's module to operate some arithmetic application

4. Last thing, we want to discuss how we can create directory on Google Colab
